# Desktop Icons Circle Layout

## Description
This Python script arranges your Windows desktop icons into a dynamic circular pattern. The radius adjusts automatically based on the number of icons present.

## Requirements
- Python installed
- `pywin32` library

## Installation
Install the necessary Python package using pip:

```bash
pip install pywin32
```

## Usage
1. Adjust the `center_x` and `center_y` variables in the script if your screen resolution differs from the default (1920x1080).
2. Run the script with administrative privileges:

```bash
python circle_icons_layout.py
```

## Note
- You may need to rerun the script after rebooting or refreshing your desktop.

## Troubleshooting
- If the icons don't move, ensure you're running the script with administrator privileges.
- Confirm that your Python environment correctly installed `pywin32`.
